# Managing Website Dependencies

*A presentation on managing dependencies for websites*

To view the presentation, open the presentation/index.html file in your browser. If you would like to save it as PDF, check the instructions on [reveal.js PDF export](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#pdf-export).

This repository is organized into branches that follow the steps in the presentation. If you want to follow along, switch branches to get the code corresponding to the step in the presentation. Note that the `vendor` folders and `.env` files are .gitignored, so you may have to force overwrites with the `-f` checkout flag.

```
$ git checkout -f step-02
```

This is a test branch.
